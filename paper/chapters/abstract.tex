\begin{abstract}
This document presents a systematic core-satellite portfolio strategy designed for long-term wealth accumulation through dynamic ETF selection. The strategy combines the stability of a passive global core (60\% allocation to MSCI ACWI) with tactical satellite positions (40\% allocation across 3-5 selected ETFs) that aim to generate positive alpha. We develop a comprehensive signal-based framework consisting of 167 signal bases, 27 causal smoothing filters, and 25 cross-sectional indicators, yielding over 112,000 potential features for predicting 3-month forward alpha. The strategy employs quarterly rebalancing to maintain the core-satellite ratio while locking profits from successful satellite positions into the core allocation, creating a systematic risk-reduction mechanism over time. Through walk-forward backtesting and rigorous feature evaluation, we identify which signal-filter-indicator combinations demonstrate consistent predictive power for ETF selection. The strategy is optimized for a 30+ year investment horizon with monthly contributions of EUR 1,000 and negligible transaction costs, making it suitable for tax-efficient, long-term portfolio growth.
